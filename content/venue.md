## Coming to Zurich by train

BSides Zurich is hosted in the “Binz-Quartier” of Zurich. To reach it from
Zurich HB (main station), there are several possibilities:

The best options are to take the S10 direction “Uetliberg” from HB (marked as
“SZU” line) to “Zürich Binz”, leaving HB every hour at .15, .35 and .55.
(Estimated 8 minute walk) and walk the last 650m to the location. In case you
miss the exit, the stop “Zürich Friesenberg” takes you about the same amount of
time walking to the location. In case you want a bus straight to the front door,
the bus stop “Grubenstrasse” is the closest and is served by the bus lines 66
and 76. As the bus line 76 runs by the train stop “Zürich Wiedikon”, this might
be an option in case you don’t want to exit at “Zürich HB”. It runs every hour
at .07, .22, .37 and .52 and takes 8 minutes to reach us.

## Coming to Zurich by plane

To reach us from Zurich airport, best take one of the trains to “Zurich HB” and
change to local trains there. You have the S16, running every hour at .01 and
.31; the S24, running every hour at .03 and .33 and the S2, running every hour
at .06 and .36. There are also regional trains in between that have their next
stop to be Zürich HB. Please check the schedule for that. Please note that with
the S24 and S2, you could also stay on the train and exit at the stop “Zürich
Wiedikon” and take the bus from there (see the “Coming to Zurich by train”
section).
