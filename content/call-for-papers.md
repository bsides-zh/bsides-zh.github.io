## Conference format

We want BSides Zurich to be a different kind of conference, where attendees and
speakers have a real opportunity to mingle and engage in active discussion. In
order to achieve this, we chose an atypical conference format that our attendees
have really enjoyed.

There are a total of 6 talks, all in English. Talks are grouped by 3 and are
divided into two sessions (morning and afternoon). Each talk is only 20 minutes
long, and after the 3 morning talks, each speaker gets an assigned room and
organize an hour-long breakout “discussion” session. Participants can pick the
talk that interested them the most and attend that session. Or they can just ask
a few questions, and hop onto another session! Think of discussion sessions as
an hour-long Q&A where participants and speakers can really take time to ask and
answer questions, deep-dive into that demo, and get into the nitty-gritty
details of their topic. The same happens after lunch, in the afternoon.

A typical day at BSides Zurich goes like this:

```
09:45 – 10:00 Welcome and Event presentation
10:00 – 10:30 Keynote
10:30 – 11:00 Coffee break

* Morning session start*
11:00 – 12:00 3x20m presentations
12:00 – 13:00 discussion groups hop on hop off + coffee break
* Morning session end *

13:00 – 14:00 lunch + coffee break

*Afternoon session start*
14:30 – 15:30 3x20m presentations
15:30 – 16:30 discussion groups hop on hop off + coffee break
* Afternoon session end *

16:30 – 17:00 closing remarks
```

In a nutshell, as a speaker you should rememebr to **prepare a talk that can be
given in 20 minutes**, and **enough material for an hour of Q&A**.

## Submitting a talk

As mentioned above, your talk should be **20 minutes long**, and provide enough
discussion points for **about an hour of Q&A** session.

The process for submitting is fairly straightofrward - provide an abstract of
your talk (ideally with an outline of the points you’re planning to cover, and
some discussion points you’re planning to raise during your breakout session)
and send it to &lt;EASYCHAIR / CPF PLATFORM>.

The main topic, as you may have guessed, is cybersecurity, and any topic goes:
reverse engineering, application security, forensics, incident response, threat
intelligence, hardware exploitation…

To summarize:

- Language: the talk and slides must be in English.
- Duration: Talks are 20 minutes long, so make sure you keep it short and sweet!
- Q&A: The breakout sessions are about 45 minutes long and will give you plenty
  of time to go into more depth.
- We recommend that you end your presentation with questions that will encourage
  dialogue with your audience – people are often shy to start with!

### Shepherding process

Our industry is full of experienced speakers who give great talks. But we also
like to have new people talk at BSides!

To enourage first-time presenters to submit papers, we have been running a
special opt-in “Shepherding program”. This is specifically geared towrads
first-time presenters, but also experienced presenters who feel unsure about the
format of their talk and whether it’s adapted to the conference.

The program pairs submitters with some members of the Programm Committee, so
that they spend some hours working together (usually asynchronously over email)
to generate feedback and tweak the presentation so that it’s better suited for
the conference format.

Some more details:

- The program is completely opt-in, but we do ask pariticpants to commit to
  working on the feedback from their mentors to make it worth everyone’s time;
- The Program Committe does not take participation into the shepherding program
  into account when picking talks; it is also not reflected in the program;
- Going through the shepherding process **offers no guarantee that your talk
  will get picked**, but it does increase the chances quite a bit.
- Naturally, deadlines for participating in the shepherding program are about a
  month earlier than for regular submissions.

### Selection process

Once all submissions are in, each submission gets reviewed by a subset (~25%) of
the Program Committe and rated according to criteria like technical depth,
novelty, potential for creating interesting discussion, etc. After all ratings
are in, the organizers and PC members meet and pick the talks that made it to
the top in most situations.

Tips for good submissions:

- **Make sure** to respect the format (20 minutes talk, adapted to the breakout
  session model)
- Please **no sales pitches** or single product reviews.
- **No demos** or videos in your talk (it’s OK to keep them for the
  Q&A/Discussion session)
- Make sure to put sufficient care, attention, and time into your submission. If
  it’s botched or unclear and we’re not able to properly evaluate it, we won’t
  accept it
