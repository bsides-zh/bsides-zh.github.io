## Conference format

We want BSides Zurich to be a different kind of conference, where attendees and
speakers have a real opportunity to mingle and engage in active discussions. In
order to achieve this, we chose an atypical conference format that our attendees
have really enjoyed.

There are a total of 6 talks plus a keynote, all in English. Talks are grouped
by 3 and are divided into two sessions (morning and afternoon). Each talk is
only 20 minutes long, and after the 3 morning talks, each speaker gets an
assigned room for a 30-minute-long breakout “discussion” session. Participants
can pick the talk that interested them the most and attend that session. Or they
can just ask a few questions, and hop onto another session! Think of discussion
sessions as a 30-minute-long Q&A where participants and speakers can really take
time to ask and answer questions, deep-dive into that demo, and get into the
nitty-gritty details of their topic. The same happens after lunch, in the
afternoon.

A typical day at BSides Zurich goes like this:

```
08:45 – 09:30 Registration
09:30 – 09:45 Welcome and Event presentation
09:45 – 10:30 Keynote
10:30 – 11:00 Coffee break

Morning session
11:00 – 12:10 3 x 20 short talks
12:15 – 12:25 Short Coffee break
12:30 – 13:00 Discussion groups hop on hop off
13:00 – 14:15 Lunch break

Afternoon session
14:30 – 15:40 3 x 20 short talks
15:45 – 15:55 Short Coffee break
16:00 – 16:30 Discussion groups hop on hop off
16:35 – 17:00 Closing remarks and... swag
17:00 – Social Drinks
```

In a nutshell, as a speaker you should remember to **prepare a talk that can be
given in 20 minutes**, and **enough material for a 30-minute-long Q&A**.

## Submitting a talk

As mentioned above, your talk should be **20 minutes long**, and provide enough
discussion points for **about a half hour of Q&A** session.

The process for submitting is fairly straightforward - provide an abstract of
your talk (ideally with an outline of the points you’re planning to cover, and
some discussion points you’re planning to raise during your breakout session)
and send it to us. <!-- TODO: EASYCHAIR / CPF PLATFORM -->

The main topic, as you may have guessed, is cybersecurity, and any topic goes:
reverse engineering, application security, forensics, incident response, threat
intelligence, hardware exploitation…

To summarize:

- Language: the talk and slides must be in English.
- Duration: Talks are 20 minutes long, so make sure you keep it short and sweet!
- Q&A: The breakout sessions are about 30 minutes long and will give you plenty
  of time to go into more depth.
- We recommend that you end your presentation with questions that will encourage
  dialogue with your audience – people are often shy to start with!

### Mentoring program

Our industry is full of experienced speakers who give great talks. But we also
like to have new people talk at BSides!

To encourage first-time presenters to submit papers, we have been running a
special opt-in mentoring program. This is specifically geared towards
first-time presenters, but also experienced speakers who feel unsure about the
format of their talk and whether it’s adapted to the conference.

The program pairs potential presenters with some members of the Program
Committee, so that they spend some hours working together (usually
asynchronously over email) to generate feedback and tweak the presentation so
that it’s better suited for the conference format.

Some more clarifications:

- The program is completely opt-in, but we do ask participants to commit to
  working on the feedback from their mentors to make it worth everyone’s time;
- The Program Committee does not take participation into the mentoring program
  into account when picking talks. Participation into the program will not be
  reflected in the conference agenda, or otherwise shared outside the Program
  Committee;
- Going through the mentoring program **offers no guarantee that your talk will
  get selected, but it does increase the chances quite a bit.
- Naturally, deadlines for participating in the mentoring program are about a
  month earlier than for regular submissions.

### Selection process

Once all submissions are in, each submission gets reviewed by a subset (~25%) of
the Program Committee and rated according to criteria like technical depth,
novelty, potential for creating interesting discussion, etc. After all ratings
are in, the organizers and PC members meet and pick the talks that made it to
the top in most situations.

Tips for good submissions:

- Make sure to respect the format (20 minutes talk, adapted to the breakout
  session model)
- Please **no sales pitches** or single product reviews.
- **No demos** or videos in your talk (it’s OK to keep them for the
  Q&A/Discussion session)
- Make sure to put sufficient care, attention, and time into your submission. If
  it’s botched or unclear and we’re not able to properly evaluate it, we won’t
  accept it
