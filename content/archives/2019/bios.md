### Claudio Criscione (_[@paradoxengine](https://twitter.com/paradoxengine)_)

Claudio Criscione has been doing and speaking about security for an
embarrassingly large number of years, mostly in the cloud and web space. After a
career consulting about breaking systems, he is now managing security scanning
for Google under the motto “no facepalm pwnages”. His colleagues are likely to
argue his main role is complaining about food, and would probably not be
completely wrong.

### Jannis Kirschner ([@xorkiwi](https://twitter.com/xorkiwi))

Jannis is a Swiss security researcher and ctf player. With a passion for reverse
engineering and exploit development, he loves to analyze complex applications.
He got the chance to prove himself in several national and international
cybersecurity competitions. \
Being faced with auditing the Swisspost’s e-voting solution he got heads deep into
the codebase, discovering multiple technical and non-technical flaws.

### Jonas Wagner (_[@\_jwagner](https://twitter.com/_jwagner)_)

Jonas Wagner is an engineer and malware researcher with a focus on automated
malware analysis. For the last couple of years, he has been working on finding
new ways of efficiently comparing binary code at large scale, which has lead to
new insights on technology and malware. Recently, he co-founded threatray, a
startup that uses large-scale binary code similarity search to deliver threat
intelligence.

### Julien Voisin

Julien (jvoisin) Voisin used to pwn and reverse stuff while contributing to
radare2. Nowadays, he spending time on, amongst other things, killing bug
classes in PHP applications by maintaining Snfflueupagus
([snuffleupagus.rtfd.io](http://snuffleupagus.rtfd.io/)) while keeping his own
bugs alive on websec.fr, running high-speed Tor relays, and ranting on
dustri.org. He also possess a significant catalog of terrible facts about PHP
and Java.

### Michael Kurth (_[@mik\_\_](https://twitter.com/mik__)_)

Michael Kurth has computer science master’s degree from ETH Zurich. He did an exchange
Master thesis at VUSec in Amsterdam. One of the leading research groups for microarchitectural
attacks. Don’t ask him about his master’s thesis, because he can’t tell you anything
about it at the moment, i.e. coordinated disclosure ;-). He is now working at InfoGuard
as cyber security analyst.

### Ravishankar Borgaonkar (_[@raviborgaonkar](https://twitter.com/raviborgaonkar)_)

Ravishankar Borgaonkar works as a research scientist at Sintef Digital and
undertakes research in securing next generation digital communication. His
primary research themes are related to mobile telecommunication and involved
security threats. This ranges from 2G/3G/4G/5G network security to end-user
device security. After receiving his PhD in ‘security in telecommunication’ area
from the technical university of Berlin, he was a security researcher at
Deutsche Telekom’s lab for 3 years. Since that time he has worked for Intel
Collaborative Research Institute for Secure Computing at Aalto University, as
well as for the University of Oxford focusing on 5G security research. He has
found several protocol flaws in 3G/4G technologies and assisted in shaping the
5G security architecture. The demonstrated vulnerabilities affected billions of
3G/4G devices and resulted a change in the existing 3G/4G communication
standards.
