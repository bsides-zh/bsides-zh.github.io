BSides Zurich is dedicated to providing a harassment-free, constructive,
inclusive and pleasant atmosphere for everyone. We encourage all participants to
make each other feel welcome and included in activities throughout the
conference. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of conference
participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of
the conference organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to:
  - Gender
  - Gender identity and expression
  - Sexual orientation
  - Disability
  - Physical appearance
  - Body size
  - Race
  - Age
  - Religion
  - Clothing
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Questioning appropriate use of facilities by queer or non-conforming
  individuals
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors

## Enforcement

**Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.**

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the
right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all
participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the
conference with no refund.

Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the
clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any
participants.

**We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and
event-related social activities.** We think people should follow these rules
outside event activities too!

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the
value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People
like you make our event a better place.

Contact a conference volunteer, identified by a volunteer shirt/lanyard, the
volunteer will get one of the organizers to take your report. Or you can contact
an organizer directly, identified by an organizer shirt/lanyard.

When taking a personal report, our volunteers will ensure you are safe and
cannot be overheard. They may involve other event volunteers or the conference
organizers to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you
to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as
respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won’t be
asked to confront anyone, and we won’t tell anyone who you are.
