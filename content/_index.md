# What is BSides?

Security BSides is a community-driven framework for building events by and for information security community members. These events are already happening in major cities all over the world! We are responsible for organizing an independent BSides-Approved event for Zurich, Switzerland.

The idea behind the Security BSides events is to organise a free Information Security conference where professionals, experts, researchers, and InfoSec enthusiasts come together to discuss. It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening.

# Why this conference?
Nowadays there are many conferences under the guise of cybersecurity, information security, digital forensics and incident response or equivalent, but we wanted to increase the level at which attendees interact and exchange ideas, both between themselves and the speakers.

Therefore, we decided to go for a more interactive format where attendees learn from one another and exchange ideas on how we can improve information security.

The idea behind the whole concept is to have short talks (20 minutes each), because we believe that time is enough to state a point about problems, new solutions, new attack/defense techniques, etc., and leave most of the time to discussions and exchange. Check the CfP and Agenda sections of the site to learn more.
